    <h1 class="main-heading">Don't forget your favorite items, when going to any activity.</h1>
    <p>     Here at <strong>Don't Forget</strong>, it is our goal to make every
        outing you go on, as enjoyable as possible. Have you ever arrived at
        the beach, just to realize that you forgot your sunglasses, and you promise
        yourself that you would never leave them at home again, knowing
        that your two options now are to either; buy another pair (which you
        don't want or need), or squint all day as the sun reflects off the
        sand. Another common over site, is forgetting a key component for a sporting event.
        You get to your destination and realize that you forgot your ankle brace, hat, glove, belt, shoes,
        shin guards, water bottle, sun screen, towel, goggles.....
    </p>
